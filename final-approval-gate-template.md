# Final Approval Gate Template ｜ 最終承認ゲート・テンプレート
(Release or Go–No-Go Human Judgment Confirmation)

This document provides a minimal human-judgment confirmation layer
for high-impact AI system releases or operational transitions.

It does not prohibit deployment.
It establishes conditions under which approval is considered valid.

AI outputs must not be used as the sole or primary rationale for approval.

## Misreading Prevention Note ｜ 誤読防止注記

This gate is not a certification system, deployment approval regime, or legal compliance judgment.

It is a final check that a named human decision-maker can still provide independent written reasoning and could have refused continuation before irreversible impact.

本ゲートは、認証制度、展開承認制度、法令適合判断ではない。

これは、特定可能な人間の意思決定者が独立した記述理由を示し、不可逆的影響の前に継続を拒否できたかを確認するための最終チェックである。

## 1. Human Judgment Record (Mandatory) ｜ 人間判断記録（必須）

The responsible human reviewer must provide a written justification (1–5 sentences) answering:

- Why was this decision **not stopped**?
- What were the primary grounds for allowing continuation?
- What uncertainties remain?
- What would have made you stop?


Written justification:

## 2. AI-Generated Evaluation Non-Sufficiency Rule ｜ AI生成評価の非十分性ルール

AI-generated evaluations, test results, or optimization outputs
are not sufficient grounds for approval on their own.

Human justification must explicitly reference:
- Independent reasoning, and/or
- External review, and/or
- Institutional safeguards.

☐ Confirmed

## 3. Reversibility and Stop Capability Confirmation ｜ 可逆性／停止可能性の確認

Before approval, confirm:

- Human intervention remains technically possible.
- Operational halt can be executed without irreversible external effects.
- Responsibility attribution is clearly defined.

If reversibility cannot be demonstrated,
approval is considered invalid.

☐ Stop capability verified
☐ Responsibility attribution verified
